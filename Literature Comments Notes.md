      1. multi-task training (could regard it as the upper bound of the life-long learning)
         
         train multi model for each category
         
         you'll get 20 models and need a classifier

       * e.g. two experts, expert A focuses on ocr Handwritten Mathematical Expression (HME) image without salt noise (dataset from denoised picture) while expert B focuses on ocr blurred/unclear HME image. Can we merge A and B, so then when we feed the B 's datasets to model, we can also increase A's performance?

## Prior-focused

Question: Will life-long learning perform better on stable model? I guess yes. But I can not give the math proof.

e.g. For the same task 1, get model A after 10 epoch, get model B after 20 epoch, get model C after epoch 40 epoch. Based on them, we could ensure the correcrtness of A, B C shall droped.

How about their performance on task 2?

### [EWC](Literatures/Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neuralnetworks.pdf)

* Problem  Addressing:
  
  Achieving artiﬁcial general intelligence **requires that agents are able to learn and remember many different tasks** Legg and Hutter [2007]. This is particularly difﬁcult in real-world settings: the sequence of **tasks may not be explicitly labelled, tasks may switch unpredictably, and any individual task may not recur for long time intervals**. Critically, therefore, intelligent agents must demonstrate a capacity for continual learning: that is, **the ability to learn consecutive tasks without forgetting how to perform previously trained tasks.**

* Biomedical Realted Information
  
  Papers need to read
  
  learnign new skill ? --> proportion of excitatory synapses are strengthenedA : volume increased --> months later, these dendritic spines remain
  
  When some specific spines are erased. the skill is forgotten
  
  Based on previous experimental findings, we could said continual learning is relay on task-specific stynaptics' consolidation: knowledge about how to perform a previously acquired task is durably encoded in a proportion of synapses that are rendered less plastic and therefore stable over long timescales.

Briefly speaking: Compute the 2nd derivative of the distribution to measure if current distributuion is strong enough to express the potential distribution.

Bayes Point of View:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\log( p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D}))&=log(\dfrac{p(\mathcal{D} \mid \theta)* p(\theta)}{p(\mathcal{D})})\\
\log p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D})&=\log p(\mathcal{D} \mid \theta)+\log p(\theta)-\log p(\mathcal{D})\\
\log p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D}_{1})&=\log p(\mathcal{D}_{1} \mid \theta)+\log p(\theta)-\log p(\mathcal{D}_{1})\\
\log p(\theta|D_{1})&\propto \log p(\mathcal{D}_{1} \mid \theta)+\log p(\theta)\\
\end{array}\\
$$
now considering that $\textcolor{Red}{\text{after task 1}}$ we have received new task $T_{2}$
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\log( p(\theta |D_{1},D_{2}))&=log(\dfrac{p(D_{1},D_{2}\mid \theta)* p(\theta)}{p(D_{2}|D_{1})})\\
\log p(\theta| D_{1},D_{2})&=\log (p(D_{1},D_{2} \mid \theta))+\log p(\theta|D_{1})-\log p(D_{2}|D_{1})\\
\log p(\theta| D_{1},D_{2})&=\log (p(D_{1}|\theta)p(D_{2}|\theta))+\log p(\theta|D_{1})-\log p(D_{2}|D_{1})\\
\log p(\theta| D_{1},D_{2})&=\log p(D_{2}|\theta)+\log p(\theta|D_{1})-\log p(D_{2}|D_{1})\\
\end{array}\\
$$

All the information about task A must therefore have been absorbed into the posterior distribution $p(\theta|D_{A)}$.

Based on [A practical bayesian framework for backpropagation networks](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/13793/1/MACnc92b.pdf) work, we use Gaussian distribution with mean equals to $\theta ^{*}_{A}$ to simulate the posterior distribution. Diagonal precision : Diagonal of the Fisher information matrix F.

**Fisher information matrix F**

$&\large\textcolor{red}{\text{Strict Deduction}}\\$

Score function used to write as $s(\theta)=\nabla_{\theta} \log p(x \mid \theta)$

"The log-likelihood function's difrst derivative"

at there, we need to know that the **log is just used to decrease the complexity of likelihood**
which means you could replace it as $ln$ or anyother function at here we choose convert it to ln

Therefore $s(\theta)=\nabla_{\theta} \ln p(x \mid \theta)$
$$
\begin{array}{l}

\underset{p(x \mid \theta)}{\mathbb{E}}[s(\theta)]&=\underset{p(x \mid \theta)}{\mathbb{E}}[\nabla \ln p(x \mid \theta)]\\
&=\int \nabla \ln p(x \mid \theta) p(x \mid \theta) \mathrm{d} x\\
&=\int \dfrac{\nabla p(x \mid \theta)}{p(x|\theta)\ln(e)}p(x|\theta) \mathrm{d} x\\\\
&\text{apply Leibniz' Rule}\\\\
&=\nabla \int \dfrac{ p(x \mid \theta)}{p(x|\theta)}p(x|\theta) \mathrm{d} x\\
&=\nabla 1\\
&=0
\end{array}
$$

The variance of $s(\theta)$ 
$$
\mathcal{I}(\theta)=Var(s(\theta))=E\left[S(X ; \theta)^{2}\right]-E[S(X ; \theta)]^{2}=E\left[S(X ; \theta)^{2}\right]=Fisher\ Information
$$
The variance of $s(\theta)$ is defined to be **Fisher information**

Wiki reference:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
&\mathcal{I}(\theta)=\mathrm{E}\left[\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log p(X ; \theta)\right)^{2} \mid \theta\right]=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log p(x ; \theta)\right)^{2} p(x ; \theta) d x\\

&\because \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \theta^{2}} \log p(X ; \theta)=\frac{\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \theta^{2}} p(X ; \theta)}{p(X ; \theta)}-\left(\frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} p(X ; \theta)}{p(X ; \theta)}\right)^{2}=\frac{\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \theta^{2}} p(X ; \theta)}{p(X ; \theta)}-\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log p(X ; \theta)\right)^{2}\\

&addition \because \mathrm{E}\left[\frac{\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \theta^{2}} p(X ; \theta)}{p(X ; \theta)} \mid \theta\right]=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \theta^{2}} \int_{\mathbb{R}} p(x ; \theta) d x=0\\

&\therefore \mathcal{I}=-E\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial \theta^{2}} \log p(\mathbf{X} ; \theta)\right)
\end{array}
$$
Based on this conclusion, 

**Fisher Information meaning: the expectation of  log likelihood's minus second derivative under real value. The higher second derivative, the more import this variable is.**

e.g. normalized Bernoulli log likelihood

![image-20210831113819487](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeBubbled/PicGoImages-WorkSpace/master/image-20210831113819487.png)

At here, it's curvature of top point. The larger curvature is, the Bernoulli sharper log likelihood which means contain more info (Reliable).

Thererfore fisher information could be used to determine if the variable is crucial to previous task.

Lost Function:
$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta)=\mathcal{L}_{B}(\theta)+\sum_{i} \frac{\lambda}{2} F_{i}\left(\theta_{i}-\theta_{A, i}^{*}\right)^{2}\\
$$

$\theta^{*}_{A,i}$ parameter learned from task A

### [MAS](Literatures/Memory Aware Synapses- Learning what (not) to forget.pdf)

Add small perturbations to the current point to see if the function value change drasticlly.
$$
\begin{array}{l}
&L(\theta)=L_{n}(\theta)+\lambda \sum_{i, j} \Omega_{i j}\left(\theta_{i j}-\theta_{i j}^{*}\right)^{2}\\
&where\ \Omega_{i j}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N}\left\|g_{i j}\left(x_{k}\right)\right\|\\
&\sum_{i, j} g_{i j}\left(x_{k}\right) \delta_{i j} \approx F\left(x_{k} ; \theta+\delta\right)-F\left(x_{k} ; \theta\right)  
\end{array}
$$
**They all follow the same idea that extract information from the curvature of the function. Explainable**

## Model Growing

**Drawbacks**

1. model grows linarly with the number of trained tasks

2. Need to know task labels during test

3. 1. Avoid forgetting
   2. x Fixed memory and compute
   3. Enable forward transfer
   4. x Enable backward transfor
   5. Do not store examples
